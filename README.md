# Hypergraph-percolation

This repository contains:

1. 'CG_hypergraph_MP_simulation.c' 

This is a c code to perform both Monte Carlo simulations and Message Passing (MP) predictions of node and hyperedge percolation on Factor Graphs and Hypergraphs.
Specifically the code applies the algorithm to a random model of hypergraph with constant hyperedge cadinality.

2. 'GC_hypergrah_MP_simulation.data.c'

This is a c code to perform both Monte Carlo simulations and Message Passing (MP) predictions of node and hyperedge percolation on Factor Graphs and Hypergraphs.
Specifically the code applies the algorithm to a real networks read as an edge list.

3. 'senate_hypergraph.txt' 

Example of real hypegraph data stored as an edge list between nodes and hyperedges. Data coming from Austin Benson respository https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/
If you want to use this dataset in published work please refer to Austin Benson webpage for properly acknowledging the source of data.
