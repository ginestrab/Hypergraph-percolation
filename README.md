# Hypergraph-percolation

This repository contains

'CG_hypergraph_MP_simulation.c' 

This is a c code to perform both Monte Carlo simulations and Message Passing (MP) predictions of node and hyperedge percolation on Factor Graphs and Hypergraphs.
Specifically the code applies the algorithm to a random model of hypergraph with constant hyperedge cadinality.
